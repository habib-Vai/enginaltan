In 2020, Düzyatan went on a short visit to Pakistan, where Diriliş: Ertuğrul has gained popularity, accepting the invitation of a private business company.[19] Pakistan's Make-A-Wish Foundation arranged a meeting between Düzyatan and three young terminally ill fans;[20] when there, Engin said, "Thank you very much, I can see I inspired you and I am very happy for this love."[21] After signing an agreement with the Lahore-based Chaudhary Group of Companies,[22] of which he was a brand ambassador, he visited Lahore and became one of the top discussions on social media and one of his pictures with a lion went viral.[23] He was treated with "a flood of love" while the Pakistani army had to protect him to avoid a stampede of people coming up to him.[24] Düzyatan returned to Turkey after being defrauded by Pakistani TikTok star Kashif Zameer.[25] Despite this incident, Kashif Zameer claimed that Düzyatan would return to Pakistan,[26] with a clip of his "pleasant memories" going viral.[27] Düzyatan also wishes to appear in a Pakistani drama series one day, "if it has a good story."[28]
